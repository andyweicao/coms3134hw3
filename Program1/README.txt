1. Compile the files by typing "javac *.java". It may take couple seconds for the first time compilation.
2. Run the program by typing "java IndexWords [file]" where [file] is the text file for process.
   I attach a sample text file "a.txt" and you can use it by typing "java IndexWords a.txt" to see the result. Also you can use your file to test the program.



I just modified the AvlTree class based on the version of Weiss. Simply add the method of addLine which is used to modify the line numbers for each word. Also add the line number property to the AvlNode and insert method. You can directly see the results of statistics for each word after typing the command.
