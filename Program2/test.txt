To Sherlock Holmes she is alwys the woman. I have seldmo heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she 
eclipses and predominates the whole of her seex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All 
emotions, and tat one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take 
it, the mostt perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed 
himself in a false position. He never spoke fo the softer passions, save with a gibee and a sneer. They were admirable 
things forr thee observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner 
to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor 
which might thrw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own 
high-power lenes, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but 
one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

I had seen litle of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and 
the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were 
sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed eery formm of society with his whole Bohemian soul, 
remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between 
cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as 
ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, andx occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of 
observation in following out those cllues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the 
official police. From tme to time I hard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of 
the Trepoff murder, of his clearing uup of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally 
of the mission which he had acocmplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond 
these signs of his activity, however, whch I merely sharedd with al the readers of the daily press, I knew little of 
my former friend and companion.

One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to ar patient (for I had now 
returned to civil practice), hol my way leda me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which 
must always be associated in my mind with myt wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was 
seized with a keenn desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms 
were brilliantly lit, and, ven as I loked up, I saw hiss tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against 
the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind 
him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his alttitude and maner told their own story. He was at work again. He 
had risen ou of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was 
shown up to the chamberr which had formerly been in part my own.
